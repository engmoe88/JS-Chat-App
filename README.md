# JS-Chat-App
Web based real-time chat app using socket.io and nodemon

To start the app:
#1- download the repo to your local machine
#2- using your terminal, navigate to the repo 
#3- type "npm start" and hit enter to start the server. You may need to install npm on your machine if you haven't done so. Google is a good place to start if you struggle with that.
#4- open two instances of the Home.html  file and enjoy my chatting app!

Best!
